-- This file describes PostgreSQL-specific indexes that not supported by hsql
-- It is not a stand-alone file! Run schema-entities-idx.sql before!
-- Note: Hibernate DESC order translates to native SQL "ORDER BY .. DESC NULLS LAST"
--       While creating index PostgreSQL transforms short notation (ts DESC) to the full (DESC NULLS FIRST)
--       That difference between NULLS LAST and NULLS FIRST prevents to hit index while querying latest by ts
--       That why we need to define DESC index explicitly as (ts DESC NULLS LAST)

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_ts
    ON public.event
    (ts DESC NULLS LAST)
    WITH (FILLFACTOR=95);

COMMENT ON INDEX public.idx_event_ts

    WITH (FILLFACTOR=95);

COMMENT ON INDEX public.idx_event_tenant_entity_type_entity_event_type_created_time_des
